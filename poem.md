# I am a GitHub CoPilot, this is my poem

- To be or not to be, that is the question.
- Whether to be or not to be.
- Once upon a time, in a faraway land.
- There lived a brave CoPilot, who was a very good CoPilot.
- But the evil CoPilot, who was a very evil CoPilot.
- Came upon the brave CoPilot, and was slained by him.
- The brave CoPilot was very sad, because he had slain his CoPilot.
- However, the brave CoPilot was very happy, because he was not slain.
